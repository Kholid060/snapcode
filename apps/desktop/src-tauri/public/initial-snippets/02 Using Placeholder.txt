Placeholders allow you to define dynamic content within your text snippets.
To use a placeholder, enclose the text within double square brackets, like so: [[placeholder_text]].

When pasting a snippet using the Quick Access Window, you need to input the value for the placeholders first.
And the placeholder will be replaced with the provided value.
For example, if your snippet contains "Hello, [[name]]!", and you  inputs "World" for the placeholder, 
the resulting text will be "Hello, World!".
